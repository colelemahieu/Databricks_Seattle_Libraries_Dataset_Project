## Seattle Libraries Dataset Project
A project using Databricks, SQL, PySpark, and Python to analyze the open Seattle libraries dataset

This open source dataset for 2005-present can be found at [Seattle Libraries Dataset](https://data.seattle.gov/Community-and-Culture/Checkouts-by-Title/tmmm-ytt6/data_preview) (12G)

- **BasicInfo** — Prints and plots some basic statistics from the dataset
- **CharlieBrownAnalysis** — Plots the total number of checkouts per month for Charlie Brown holiday specials (books and DVDs)  
- **MaterialTypeTrends** — Plots material type pie charts in order to investigate trends by year and trends by month
    - For example, the decline of the VHS and the rise of the e-book are evident 
    - No material type checkout trends are evident on a month-by-month basis
